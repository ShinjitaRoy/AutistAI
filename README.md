About:
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of autism in individuals based on behavioral and demographic data.
The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and improve access to appropriate interventions.

Features:
Predict autism risk using ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
Preprocessing and handling of real-world autism screening datasets
Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
Interactive prediction interface
Extensible for future healthcare-based applications

Libraries:
pandas, numpy – Data handling
matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization
scikit-learn – Machine learning models
xgboost – Advanced modeling
streamlit – For web UI
